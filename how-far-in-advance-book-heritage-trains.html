  <h2>Why Heritage Trains Sell Out So Quickly</h2>
  <p>Unlike regular trains, heritage journeys have <strong>limited capacity</strong>—often just 1 departure per week, with 20-50 cabins total. Add high demand from milestone celebrations (honeymoons, anniversaries, retirement trips) and you have a recipe for instant sellouts.</p>
  
  <div class="highlight-box">
    <h3>Quick Facts</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Limited seats:</strong> 20-50 cabins per departure</li>
      <li><strong>Weekly frequency:</strong> 1-2 departures per route</li>
      <li><strong>High cancellation fees:</strong> 25-50% within 90-120 days</li>
    </ul>
  </div>

  <h2>Ideal Booking Windows by Train Type</h2>

  </div>

  <div class="route-card">
    <h3>Rocky Mountaineer (Canada)</h3>

    <p><strong>Shoulder seasons (May, October):</strong> 3-4 months may suffice.</p>
  </div>

  <h2>When Last-Minute Bookings Work</h2>
  <p>Occasionally, you can snag a cabin 30-90 days out if:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Traveling solo (single cabins open up from cancellations)</li>
    <li>Booking mid-week departures on European routes</li>
    <li>Choosing shoulder-season dates (early spring, late autumn)</li>
    <li>Being flexible on cabin type (downgrade from suite to twin)</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Special Considerations</h2>
  
  <h3>Milestone Trips</h3>
  <p>If planning for an anniversary, retirement, or milestone birthday, book as soon as you set the date. Heritage trains are bucket-list experiences with high demand during celebration seasons.</p>
  
  <h3>Multi-Country Journeys</h3>
  <p>If combining rail with pre/post stays (e.g., <a href="/vintage-train-routes-europe.html">European vintage train routes</a> with castle hotels), start planning 12-18 months out to coordinate all elements.</p>
  
  <h3>Group Travel</h3>
  <p>Need 3+ cabins? Add 6 months to the timeline above. Contact the train operator directly for group blocks.</p>

  <h2>Our Recommendation</h2>
  <p><strong>Start planning 12-15 months before your ideal travel window.</strong> This gives you:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>First pick of cabin types and positions</li>
    <li>Time to coordinate connecting flights and hotels</li>
    <li>Flexibility to shift dates if your first choice is full</li>
    <li>Access to early booking discounts (10-15% on some routes)</li>
  </ul>
